### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cristian Donoiu and I'm a senior IT engineer.

# Interests
I'm currently interrested in open source workflow/messaging oriented solutions for improving the capabilities of software. <br>
I have seen too many workflow engines implemented in house with work repeated again an again in different projects/companies. And seen too many industry "established" workflow engines that are hard to learn and use.

# Projects
The main open source projects that I have fun with are:
* **floref** - a java workflow engine, in progress of beeing released. <br>
   Main goal: Create the most easy to learn and use Java workflow engine. 
* [mongopipe.org](https://www.mongopipe.org) . Allows managing MongoDB pipelines. <br>
Other goals:  Remove queries hardcoded in the code. Yes I dislike native SQL/noSQL thrown at me with a Spring @Query annotation. <br> 
Allow migration and easy change(at runtime) of queries via API/UI. **Some business changes should not wait for the code to change.**. <br>  

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone sharing similar endeavours.<br>
